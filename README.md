# ExtractPDF
### Trying to Extract Data from not-so-perfect PDF's

## About
### A little project dealing with information retreival from PDF documents.
For the time being I am only dealing with a single pdf at a time, eventually using this model for a batch procedure. 

## Installation 
### 1. Dependencies
Install Dependencies using "pip install -r Dependencies.txt"
### 2. Download Tesseract OCR 
Use the "https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases" repository (You will need it LOCALLY on your system for OCR).
You can get the Windows Installer from "https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki".
### 3. PATH
Enter path to your pdf in "pdf_path" in the declaration outside.
Add your Tesseract location to you PATH, or add your Tesseract PATH implicitly in the declared field.
